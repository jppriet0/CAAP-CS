4*4 game functional simulation:
10 times: 4.6
100 times: 4.73
1000 times: 4.726
10000000 times (just for accuracy check): 4.7598892

4*4 game matrix simulation: 
# running it more times would give exactly the same result
It took 5 steps for 99% confidence of winning.


----Extra Credit---- (it seems like the Markov simulation is understimating the number of moves by a big margin)
